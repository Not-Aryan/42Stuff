##Project Summary
 - This project takes car data and predicts fuel consumption based on engine size. The reason why I made this project was because I was applying linear regression. Linear regression is a machine learning model that fits a line to data.

##What is Machine Learning?
 - Machine learning is a sub section of AI that allows programs to predict things without being explicitly programmed.

##Challenges
- In this program, I didn't face too many challenges because I did something very similar in ML-3, but in that I had to tinker around and learn with how sklearn and matplotlib work.

##What I've learned
- Using pandas to get data from a csv. Using numpy/sklearn to manipulate/feature scale it. Using sklearn to both split the data in train and test sets, then fit and train a model to the data. Finally, testing my trained model and then plotting the data.
